# vt128

Work in progress. 

I pulled out the Commodore 128 the other day and thought it would be fun 
to do some BASIC programming. It wasn't fun. The keyboard is weird, the 
left shift key is sticky, line numbers are old school, two character variable 
names are way too old school. 

So I got the idea to write a BASIC tokenizer that can be developed on 
a normal machine and then executed in the VICE emulator. That is the 
goal for now and subject to change. 

First order of business is a disk reader and writer. Yes, tools already 
exist for that but why not have some fun.
